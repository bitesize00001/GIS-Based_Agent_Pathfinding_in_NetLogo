# GIS-Based_Agent_Pathfinding_in_NetLogo

##  Overview

This NetLogo model simulates agent-based pathfinding within an urban environment. Agents are programmed to navigate toward buildings while avoiding bus stops, using spatial constraints derived from a GIS-based map layout.

##  Model Objective

- Demonstrate basic spatial navigation using NetLogo’s GIS capabilities.
- Allow agents to find shortest or optimal paths to buildings.
- Exclude bus stops as target destinations and/or avoid them as obstacles.

##  Features

- **GIS Layer Integration:** Import of spatial layers (buildings, roads, bus stops).
- **Agent Navigation:** Rule-based pathfinding logic.
- **Selective Pathfinding:** Agents only navigate to buildings, not bus stops.
- **Visual Output:** Animated agent movement, destination highlighting.

##  How It Works

1. **Setup**
   - Load GIS layers (e.g., shapefiles/raster).
   - Initialize patches as either walkable, building, or bus stop.

2. **Agent Creation**
   - Agents spawn at defined locations.
   - Each agent is assigned a target (building).

3. **Pathfinding Logic**
   - Agents find a path using distance-based or heuristic navigation.
   - Bus stops are flagged and avoided during routing.

4. **Simulation Loop (`go`)**
   - Agents move step-by-step toward the nearest building.
   - Routes adjust dynamically if blocked.

##  Technologies

- **NetLogo** (ABM platform)
- **GIS Extension** (for spatial data handling)

##  Notes

- Designed for research or teaching purposes.
- Can be extended to multi-modal navigation, accessibility simulation, or emergency evacuation modeling.
